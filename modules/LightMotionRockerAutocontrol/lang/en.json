	"m_descr": "Controls ligth switches via one or many motion sensors and any number of rockers. If rocker operation happened, motion does not turn on for a short time (rocker relax time). Once all motion sensors reported no motion, wait for a defined time (motion off period) and turn off light. Motion events are ignored if luminance is lower than a defined threshold. After some long time after last motion event or rocket on event turn off light (in case of low battery in one of the motion sensors).",

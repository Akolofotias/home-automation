In case there are only two scenes defined this element will toggle between these two scenes. This setup is particularly useful if there are multiple scenes for one room or zone that are typically executed in a defined order (Example: Three scenes in sleeping room: 1 enter the room â€“> light up the room, 2 move to bed -> dim the light but still keep it up, 3 sleep -> everything is off, 4 - > wakeup in the morning -> only dim the light)<br><br>Settings:<br><ul><li>List of scenes to be activates in round robin</li></ul>",
